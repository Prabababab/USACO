# USACO Solutions

  This is currently a new project without comments. It also exhibits some... questionable naming.
  However, I will try to make modifications to make this easier to work with.
  
## Organization Description

  1) Find the years of the USACO season you are looking for (e.g. "2018-2019")
  2) Find the number corresponding to which contest number of the year it corresponds to (e.g. January would be "2nd" since it's the second contest of the year).
     It's done this way because the contests show up in chronological order when alphebetically sorted.
  3) Navigate to the division you're looking for.
  4) Find the contest problem number you're looking for (e.g. "problem2"). Once again, this is adopted so problems appear in the order they were given.
